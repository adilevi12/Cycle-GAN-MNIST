# Cycle-GAN-MNIST
Generate images from cycle GAN model and visualize its latent spaces. Demonstrate how a cycle GAN generates a digit with a color that
belongs to another digit. For example, if we use in the training set red for the digit one and the color yellow for two. We would like to generate a new ‘one’ sample
with yellow.<br>
